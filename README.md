# Deep Reinforcement Learning-CartPole
Double Q-Learning to play CartPole

This project is similar to <a href="https://github.com/ykteh93/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning-Atari">my other project</a> on Atari games, except double Q-learning is implemented here.

* Q-learning uses same values to select and to evaluate, while double Q-learning decouples that with two separate network. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf">The details motivation can be read here.</a>
